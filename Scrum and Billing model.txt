1) Before Scrum, we used to estimate the whole project in man days and 
provide the client with an invoice based on total man days x daily 
rate = project cost. 

Now that we have Scrum.....we do the same thing. 

Is there a Scrum specific approach to billing? I remember reading 
something about billing per iteration but the problem I have with this 
is that we still have to provide an estimate up front for the client.
